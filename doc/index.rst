AgML - Machine Learning for Agricultural Modeling
=================================================

AgML is the `AgMIP <https://agmip.org/>`_ transdisciplinary community of agricultural and machine learning modelers.

AgML aspires to:

- Identify key research gaps and opportunities at the intersection of agricultural modeling and machine learning research.
- Support enhanced collaboration and engagement between experts in these disciplines.
- Conduct and publish protocol-based studies to establish best practices for robust machine learning use in agricultural modeling.

AgML Crop Yield Forecasting
---------------------------

The objective of the AgML Crop Yield Forecasting task is to create a benchmark to compare models for crop yield forecasting across countries and crops. The models and forecasts can be used for food security planning or famine early warning.
