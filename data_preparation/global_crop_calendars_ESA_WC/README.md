# Global Crop Calendar from the WorldCereal project

## Short description
The dataset includes start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) maps for wheat and maize at 0.5° spatial resolution. The maps are generated in the framework of WorldCereal project, funded by European Space Agency (ESA). The maps were built using existing global crop calendar products, as produced by the Group on Earth Observations’ Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Crop Monitor, the United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service (USDA-FAS), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the European Commission Joint Research Center’s Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production (ASAP). These datasets were combined into a baseline map and sampled to train a Random Forest algorithm based on climatic and geographic data.
