# FEWSNET subnational crop yield statistics
The dataset includes information on specific cropping seasons, crop production systems, and population groups. The data is collected from a variety of sources, including national statistical offices and agricultural ministries. The subnational crop yield statistics are linked to shapefiles for subnational administrative boundaries as they change over time and the statistics are harmonized accordingly to create continuous time series.
