# Global temporary crop, maize and winter cereals area fraction images
IIASA and JRC developed a global cropland map compatible with the JRC FPAR 500 m time series from the hybridization of several high resolution global cropland layers. Cropland is identified by masks with 500 m spatial resolution expressed as area fraction image (AFI, i.e. the percentage of the pixel area occupied by temporary crops, ranging from 0 to 100%). AFI are typically used in the process of aggregation (of remote sensing and meteorological data) at the desired administrative level (e.g. GAUL1 or GAUL2 level) where spatial averaging is performed using AFI as weighting factor.
