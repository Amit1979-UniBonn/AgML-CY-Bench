# AgML - Machine Learning for Agricultural Modeling

AgML is the [AgMIP](https://agmip.org/) transdisciplinary community of agricultural and machine learning modelers.

AgML aspires to
* identify key research gaps and opportunities at the intersection of agricultural modelling and machine learning research,
* support enhanced collaboration and engagement between experts in these disciplines, and
* conduct and publish protocol-based studies to establish best practices for robust machine learning use in agricultural modelling.

## AgML Crop Yield Forecasting
The objective of AgML Crop Yield Forecasting task is to create a benchmark to compare models for crop yield forecasting across countries and crops. The models and forecasts can be used for food security planning or famine early warning.
